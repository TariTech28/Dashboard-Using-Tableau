  Methodology:

The following methodology was used to create the dashboard:

- **Data collection:**
The first step was to collect the data required for the dashboard. This data was sourced from 10Alytics.
- **Data preparation:**
Once the data was collected, it was necessary to prepare it for analysis. This involved cleaning the data, formatting it in a way that was compatible with Tableau.
- **Data analysis**: The next step was to analyze the data and identify the key metrics that would be tracked on the dashboard. These metrics included total profit, shipping delay, product category, shipping mode, and forecasted profits.
- **Visualization design:** Once the key metrics had been identified, the next step was to design the visualizations that would be used on the dashboard. The visualizations were designed to be clear, concise, and easy to understand.
- **Dashboard development:** The final step was to develop the Tableau dashboard. This involved creating the visualizations, adding filters, and configuring the dashboard layout.
- **Iteration:** The dashboard was iteratively developed, with feedback from stakeholders being incorporated at each stage. This helped to ensure that the dashboard met the needs of the users and that it was providing valuable insights.

- **Conclusion:**

The Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the company's supply chain profits, while also incorporating forecasts for the coming months. This dashboard can be used by supply chain managers to make better decisions about how to improve profitability and forecast future performance.
